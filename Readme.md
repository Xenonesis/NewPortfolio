## 🧑‍💻 Development & Best Practices

- **Accessibility**:  
  - Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for all interactive elements.
  - Ensure all links with `target="_blank"` include `rel="noopener"` for security.
  - Provide keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
  - Maintain color contrast ratios for readability.

- **Linting & Code Quality**:  
  - Run CSS linter:  
    ```sh
    npm run lint:css
    ```
  - Run HTML linter:  
    ```sh
    npm run lint:html
    ```
  - Run JS linter:  
    ```sh
    npm run lint:js
    ```
  - Follow camelCase naming conventions and fix reported style violations.

- **Versioning & Release**:  
  - Tag releases for traceability:
    ```sh
    git tag -a v40 -m "Release version 40"
    git push --tags
    ```
  - Compare versions:
    ```sh
    git log v39..v40
    git diff v39..v40
    ```

- **Documentation**:
